# Helping-Humboldt
Helping Humboldt is a progressive web application that contains information about various local resources such as healthcare services, food banks, housing resources, employment services, and more. This file is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, making it easier for people in the community to find the resources they need. The idea behind this initiative is to create a centralized location where people can easily access information about local resources that can help them in times of need. By utilizing this information in a CSV file format, we aim to make it easy for individuals, community organizations, and businesses to access and utilize the data. The CSV file is regularly updated to ensure that the information it contains is current and accurate. We rely on community feedback to make updates and additions to the file, so please do not hesitate to reach out to us if you have any suggestions or feedback. Our goal is to create a community-driven resource that helps people in Humboldt find the support and resources they need to thrive. We believe that by working together, we can build a stronger, more resilient community.
